# PES Fairization and upload to NOMAD GUI
This GUI creates an interface for users to upload raw UPS data (VAMAS format) and meta data (preformated excel sheet + one yaml file describing the setup) and the file describing the setup.

- One button combine setup + experiment description -> fuller metadata.
- One button combines it to the raw data (+ proprietary metadata)
- One button uploads it to our local NOMAD repository

TODO:
- Docker to deploy somewhere else
- Lots of functionalities still have to be added.
